I looked this up and found that it is a common problem, but for people who are updating their repository. I can't find anything about how to fix this problem for a new repository but here are my clumsy attempts


$ git pull
There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
See git-pull(1) for details.

    git pull <remote> <branch>

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

    git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<branch> master



$ git push -f
fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

I also tried to change the origin to another repository without the readme but it says "fatal: remote origin already exists." Any ideas?

Also, these are the steps I follow (the ones that github suggests never worked for me)

    git init
    git remote add origin
    git add .
    git commit -m "name"
    git push -u origin master
